# Misc. Projects that span NLP and Computer Vision

This repository is a conglomeration of a handful of deep learning projects that I have worked on over the past couple of years. Included in this repo is two projects covering small language models (one standard LSTM and one LSTM with attention), some generative vision models (VAE and GAN), and a DQN reinforcement learning pipeline.
